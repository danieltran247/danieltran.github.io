      <h1>About Dan</h1>
      My name is Daniel Tran. I go by Danny or Dan. I am 18 years old and am a freshmen at URI. I am currently majoring in computer science. <br>
      I am a student in CSC106 and am learning new coding languages such as HTML. Outside of school, my favorites hobbies are playing musical instruments or playing basketball. <br>
      I also like playing video games and would want to work for a video game company someday. My favorite basketball team is the Warriors and my favorite drink is gatorade. <br>
